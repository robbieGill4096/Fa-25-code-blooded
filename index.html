        <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This project proposes the development of an innovative mobile application leveraging
          data analytics to identify the current state of a patient and track their stage of recovery.
          By tailoring insights to each user, the app aims to provide proactive, personalized support,
          helping individuals recognize and address relapse risks before they escalate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the devastating consequences of substance use—including overdose, illness,
          and addiction-driven behaviors—this technology has the potential to significantly improve
          recovery outcomes. By utilizing modern analytics and real-time data, the app seeks to enhance
          quality of care, promote long-term sobriety, and empower individuals on their path toward
          sustained recovery.

        <h2>Project Description</h2>

        <h3>Project Structure</h3>
        <p>
          The app we developed uses Flutter for the frontend. Flutter handles all the UI elements which allows 
          for the users to interact with the app in a visually appealing way. This was chosen for the ease of development 
          and configuration for browsers and mobile devices. The backend is handled by a Node.js server. This handles the 
          actual logic behind the UI elements. This backend also acts as middleware between the frontend and the database. 
          MySQL was utilized for our database, and it stores all of the relevant informtaion that the app needs to keep track of.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Contributions (Phase 2)</h3>
        <p>
          Phase 1 of development handled the initial setup of the project as well as the basic framework and initial features. 
          Our team further developed the work the previous team left behind as well as added various new features.
        </p>

        <h4>Static Features</h4>
        <p>
          We implemented a few features available from every tab in the app. These include:
        </p>
          
        <p>
          <b>Messaging</b>: Users can send eachother messages. A user can only message another user if they are friends with eachother. 
          The chat windows allows for a user to search for conversation with other users as well as sending images to eachother.
          Users can also delete chats if they first unfriend someone.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Notifications</b>: Various actions on the app will notify the user, such as receiving a message.
        </p>

        <h4>Home Page</h4>
        <p>
          On the home page, our team made great progress in the style of the UI. We also added many new features:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Journal</b>: This allows for the creation and manipulation of journal entries for a particular user. 
          Journals can be searched through and can include images.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Friends</b>: This allows a user to search for and add or remove people from their friends list. This feature affects 
          many of the other user interaction features of the app.
        </p>

        <h4>Posts Page</h4>
        <p>
          Moving to the new tab we introduced, Posts! Posts have alot of functionality included with them:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Create Post</b>: Posts can be created by a user. Every post can have a title, caption, and an image. Posts also 
          include a privacy toggle; this allows for only the user's friends to see it or for everybody to see it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>My Posts</b>: A user can quickly view all of the posts they have created. This makes it easier for a user to edit or delete 
          a post as they choose.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Recent Posts</b>: This is where posts made by all users can be seen an interacted with. Posts are listed in creation order. Comments 
          and likes can be made on posts as well. This is where the bulk of user interaction is on this app.
        </p>

        <h4>Profile Page</h4>
        <p>
          Finally, the Profile page had some significant advancements added to it. These include:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Profile Pictures</b>: A user can now have a photo representing their account. This photo will be visible in various other parts of 
          the app, such as in posts, messages, or the friends tab.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Bio</b>: A user can have a short description of themselves on their account. This is visible to other users.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Privacy Settings</b>: A user can now toggle the visibility of various things on their account, such as their points, posts, or bio.
        </p>

        <h3>Screenshots</h3>

          <!-- Replace placeholder images with your own -->
