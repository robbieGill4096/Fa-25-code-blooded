        <p>
          This project proposes the development of an innovative mobile application leveraging
          data analytics to identify the current state of a patient and track their stage of recovery.
          By tailoring insights to each user, the app aims to provide proactive, personalized support,
          helping individuals recognize and address relapse risks before they escalate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the devastating consequences of substance use—including overdose, illness,
          and addiction-driven behaviors—this technology has the potential to significantly improve
          recovery outcomes. By utilizing modern analytics and real-time data, the app seeks to enhance
          quality of care, promote long-term sobriety, and empower individuals on their path toward
          sustained recovery.
