GitHub Page

Each team must produce a web page hosted on their GitHub repo (using GitHub Pages). This is a static html page that gives a high-level overview of the project. The intended audience is employers who want to see examples of your work and other developers who may want to fork your project and/or contribute.

You should use a GitHub template or create your own style so the web page looks like more than a simple text README document.

    This project proposes the development of an innovative mobile application leveraging data analytics to identify the current state of a patient and track their current stage of recovery. By tailoring insights to each user, the app aims to provide proactive, personalized support, helping individuals recognize and address their specific relapse risks before they escalate. Given the devastating consequences of substance use, including overdose, illness, and addiction-driven behaviors, this technology has the potential to significantly improve recovery outcomes. With a vision to enhance the quality of care and promote long-term sobriety, this initiative seeks collaboration and support to bring the concept to life. By utilizing modern technology, this app could become a vital tool in the ongoing fight against addiction, empowering individuals on their journey to sustained recovery.”
