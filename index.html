  Project Handoff

Each team must produce a brief document that details the architecture, build, and run process for the project.

The goal of the project is to allow someone who is unfamiliar with the project (i.e. me!) to perform devops once the team has graduated.

Requirements:

1. PDF Document

2. Team collaborates on writing the document

2. One person from the team submits to Canvas

3. The document should use the following format:

[Title and Sponsor]

[Team and Members]

[Semester]

[Status]

This section should give the status of the project in terms of missing functionality, whether more UX polish is needed, any challenges you unexpectedly faced in building or deploying, etc. 

[Instructions]

This section should give a very detailed description of how to build and deploy the project from scratch. If you have written robust scripts or container configurations then this will be very short, e.g. "1. Checkout repo, 2. run build.sh, 3. run start.sh". But make sure you test it in a pristine environment (such as an empty container).

[Thoughts]

Any final thoughts as well as suggestions on how the project might be extended in future semesters.
